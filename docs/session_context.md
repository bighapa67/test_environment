# DataSheetGrid Session Context

## Current Working State
```typescript
// Current working code with centered headers and formatted spread values
[code content]
```

## Key Insights
1. Component Structure Understanding:
   - Header cells use nested structure: `.dsg-cell.dsg-cell-header` containing `.dsg-cell-header-container`
   - CSS specificity is crucial for overriding default styles
   - Flexbox alignment at the container level is more effective than trying to style content directly

2. Investigation Pattern:
   - Start by examining component's source CSS
   - Look for consistent naming patterns (e.g., `dsg-` prefix)
   - Test solutions incrementally, understanding each layer
   - Use browser dev tools to verify DOM structure

3. Successful Solutions:
   - Header centering through flexbox
   - Number formatting with custom column creation
   - Type safety with proper interfaces

4. Interaction Style:
   - Methodical problem-solving approach
   - Focus on understanding root causes
   - Documentation of both what works and why it works
   - Emphasis on maintainable, clean solutions

## Current Features Implemented
1. Centered headers using CSS:
```css
.dsg-cell.dsg-cell-header {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
.dsg-cell-header-container {
  padding: 0;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}
```

2. Number formatting with two decimal places
3. Right-aligned numeric values
4. Basic grid structure with 10 rows

## Next Steps
- Explore additional DataSheetGrid features
- Consider performance optimizations
- Look into custom cell renderers
- Investigate row/column manipulation

## Code State
Current implementation includes:
- Custom text column for spread values
- Centered headers
- Type-safe row data interface
- Proper number formatting
- 10 rows of data with consistent increments

## Learning Points
1. Always check component source code for styling patterns
2. Use TypeScript types as a guide but not the sole source of truth
3. CSS specificity and structure understanding is crucial
4. Test solutions incrementally with clear understanding
5. Document both what works and why it works

## Interaction Context
- Collaborative problem-solving approach
- Focus on understanding underlying principles
- Emphasis on clean, maintainable solutions
- Active learning and documentation of insights
