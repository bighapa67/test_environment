# AI Interaction Archive Template

## How to Use This Template
Present this template to the AI assistant when you want to create an archive of your interaction. Use the following prompt:

```
Please create an interaction archive following the template in docs/interaction_archive_template.md. 
Focus on preserving both technical solutions and interaction patterns that proved effective.
The archive should be optimized for future context activation while remaining concise and well-structured.
```
